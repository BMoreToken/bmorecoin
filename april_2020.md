# April, 2022

The past few weeks have seen our fastest growth, both users and miners.

## Exchanges and Faucets

This brings me to the first question asked, where to trade? Well that’s in the works but do you know what makes it work faster, you may have guessed it, attention by the media and social media. While we work with the exchanges we ask you to help get us noticed. To reward you, we offer 1,000 BALTx a day, just follow @bmorecoin on twitter, and click our tweet button once a day!  

## Atomic Swaps

If you are an ace on the command line you can set up an atomic swap between BALTx and whatever you want. If you would like we can create a guide, just let us know! We are working on the BALT Token ( Has Multiple Liquidity Pools ) swapped with the BMoreCoin BALTx, along with LTC and ETH, but time is what we are short on, so it is on the list.

## Mining Pools

We have 2 known pools right now, working on a third, if anyone knows of one and want us to promote it we will make sure to get it on the list!

## NFTs

This one is so fresh, there is totally a bunch of ideas that need to be tested, if we figure out how, it will happen for sure.

## Lightning Network

This is just on my “figure out if we can get it to work” list, and if we can it will be amazing, else we just run a node for the community.


## Thanks!
That’s all I have for right now, there is always more going on in the discord server, especially if you need assistance!  https://discord.gg/pJNGdG6UZx
